This file is a compilation of ideas for the project

Types of stations:
Door Locks/Deadbolt
Door/Window sensors
Garage door controller
Temperature/other sensors

Deadbolt
This would be different from a door sensor.  It could use BT or WIFI or RFID.  All would be interesting keys.  It could however, be designed similarly to the garage door control, which I think online control through the network would be best.  I think that it may be better to add bluetooth so that a key can be passed to other users and only their phone is needed.
